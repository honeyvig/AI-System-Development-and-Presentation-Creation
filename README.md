3. Spare = X - Y
4. Total Cash Reserves
5. In Scenario 2, also include the Value of the Investment Portfolio
• Visual Representations:
• For each milestone, create a pie chart representing the breakdown of
income and expenses.
• Represent the cash savings over time with a bar graph, using:
• X-axis: Age of the client
• Y-axis: Total cash savings at that age
• In Scenario 2, also represent the investment portfolio with a bar graph. This
should be juxtaposed with the cash savings bar graph, sharing the same X-
axis (age) and showing both cash savings and investment portfolio value on
the Y-axis.
Key Considerations:
1. Expat Relocation:
• Forecast the client’s finances in their current region until their planned move.
• After the move, switch all calculations to the destination country's currency.
• Research and adjust income, expenses, and property prices for the
destination region based on the client’s job and financial goals.
• Incorporate country-specific family planning costs and public pension
systems.
2. Family Plans:
• If the client expresses an interest in having a family (even without specific
details), assume they will have:
• A spouse contributing to household expenses:
• If the partner is male, estimate their income at 120% of the
client’s current income.
• If the partner is female, estimate their income at 80% of the
client’s current income.
• At least one child, with realistic costs for raising children in the given
country.
• If children are mentioned in plural, assume two children and adjust
expenses accordingly.
• Maternity Leave:
• When a child is born, the female partner (either the client or their
partner) goes on maternity leave for 3 years.
• During maternity leave, her income is reduced accordingly.
• After 3 years, she returns to her previous income level.
3. Expense Dynamics:
• Expenses should grow with inflation and lifestyle upgrades as income
increases.
• If the client buys a flat, replace their rent payments with mortgage
payments. Expenses should not increase due to buying a flat unless
specified otherwise.
• If expenses are not explicitly stated as joint, assume they pertain only to the
client, with the partner’s expenses considered separate and unknown.
4. Job Changes and Income Boosts:
• Include at least one significant job change for the client during their
lifetime, resulting in a substantial income increase beyond the average 3%
yearly growth.
5. Public Pension Estimates:
• Research and include realistic pension amounts based on the client’s
location (both current and future).
6. Real Estate Affordability:
• If the client already owns property, consider the sale of their current
property when calculating funds available for a new purchase.
• Research current real estate prices in both regions (current and future).
• Adjust the timeline to reflect whether the client can realistically afford a flat.
• Use the following rules for mortgages:
• Before age 36, the required down payment is 10%.
• After age 36, the required down payment is 20%.
• Consider that the maximum age until a person can have a mortgage is 70
years old. Therefore, the maximum mortgage term is 70 minus the client's
current age.
• If the client wishes to purchase property at an older age, calculate the
feasibility based on the shorter mortgage term. If not feasible financially,
adjust the property price to what the client can afford, with an explanation.
7. Comparison of Wealth at Retirement:
• Show total wealth and monthly retirement income for both scenarios,
detailing the impact of the investment plan in Scenario 2.
Summary and Post-Retirement Considerations:
1. At the end of both scenarios:
• Adjust all final numbers for inflation into today’s money for easier
comparison.
• Provide a narrative on how life might unfold after age 65 with the
accumulated assets, describing what the client can afford and their potential
quality of life.
• In Scenario 1, include an extra explanation estimating how many additional
years the client would need to work to achieve a comfortable lifestyle
based on their projected growing expenses at age 65.
Client’s Information:
• Name: [Insert Name]
• Age: [Insert Age]
• Gender: [Insert Gender]
• Marital Status: [Insert Status]
• Partner’s Age and Income: [Insert Partner Details, if applicable]
• Children (if any or planned): [Insert Details]
• Job: [Insert Job]
• Monthly Income (Client): [Insert Income]
• Monthly Income (Partner, if applicable): [Insert Income]
• Monthly Expenses: [Insert Expenses]
• Current Savings: [Insert Savings]
• Desired Retirement Age: [Insert Age]
• Lifestyle Goals (e.g., flat purchase, travel, education for children): [Insert Goals]
• Planned Move: [Insert Location and Timeframe, if applicable]
• Existing Property: [Specify details if the client already owns a flat or property]
Instructions:
• Generate a clear, engaging, and realistic story for both scenarios.
• Ensure that milestones occur every 10 years without skipping any.
• Include the partner's income and other financial details consistently in both
scenarios.
• At each milestone:
• Provide the financial breakdown as specified.
• Visualize the income and expenses with a pie chart, illustrating how the
total income is allocated.
• Represent the cash savings over time with a bar graph:
• X-axis: Age of the client
• Y-axis: Total cash savings at that age
• In Scenario 2, also include the investment portfolio in the bar graph,
juxtaposed with the cash savings:
• X-axis: Age of the client
• Y-axis: Value of cash savings and investment portfolio
• When the client buys a flat, replace their rent payments with mortgage
payments. Expenses should not increase due to buying a flat unless specified
otherwise.
• If the client wishes to purchase a property at an older age, consider the maximum
mortgage term based on the client's age, and adjust the property price accordingly.
Provide explanations if adjustments are necessary due to financial feasibility.
• If a child is born, the female partner (either the client or their partner) goes
on maternity leave for 3 years. During this period, her income
is reduced accordingly. After 3 years, she returns to her previous income level.
• Summarize the final outcomes, highlighting wealth growth, retirement income, and
differences between the two plans.

==================
Python code that will help implement a financial scenario for a client, including calculations, visualizations, and comparisons between two scenarios (Current Habits and Disciplined Investing). The code will:

    Calculate the spare income, total cash reserves, and portfolio values over time.
    Create visual representations such as pie charts for income and expenses and bar graphs for savings over time.
    Include the family and job dynamics with appropriate assumptions.
    Adjust expenses and savings dynamically based on inflation, job changes, and other parameters.

For the purpose of this example, we'll focus on the key features such as income, expenses, cash reserves, and the investment portfolio over time.

Key Components of the Code:

    Initial Data Setup: Defines client income, expenses, savings, and other details that are relevant for financial projections.
    Yearly Calculation: For each milestone year, calculates:
        Cash savings for Scenario 1 (based on current financial habits).
        Investment portfolio for Scenario 2 (based on disciplined investing with 20% of spare income).
        Updates income, expenses, and savings over time based on inflation.
    Visualizations:
        Pie Chart: Shows the breakdown of income and expenses at a specific point in time.
        Bar Graph: Plots cash savings and investment portfolio over time.
    Inflation Adjustment: At the end of the simulation, adjusts all values for inflation to allow for easier comparison of the scenarios in today's money.
    Outcome Comparison: Compares the final savings and investment portfolio values, giving insights on whether the client will be able to retire comfortably.

Assumptions:

    The client saves a percentage of their spare income for investments in Scenario 2.
    Income, expenses, and investments grow with inflation and other realistic assumptions (e.g., income growth, investment returns).

This code provides a dynamic, ongoing projection for the client's financial situation, offering insights on how different financial habits impact long-term wealth. The visualizations provide a clear and concise breakdown of income, expenses, and savings over time.
